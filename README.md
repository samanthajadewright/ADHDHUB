Welcome to **ADHDHUB** – a fun and informative resource for ADHD! 🎉

## About the Project

### Features
- **Vibrant and playful colors** 🎨 chosen to create an inviting and energetic atmosphere.
- **Embedded YouTube videos** 📺 to provide visual insights on ADHD.
- **Spotify podcast integration** 🎧 for easy access to informative discussions.
- **User-friendly design** 🖥️ making information accessible and enjoyable.

## Learning Experience
This was my **first attempt at coding**, and I built it independently as a solo project. Through this experience, I learned the basics of web development and gained confidence in structuring and styling a webpage.

## Future Improvements
- Adding **JavaScript** for interactive elements.
- Enhancing accessibility features (Such as including light or dark mode option),
- checking site with Lighthouse for speed and usability.
- Expanding content with more curated resources.

This is a personal project, but I'm always open to feedback! Feel free to explore, enjoy, and share your thoughts.
